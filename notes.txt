-Add in step to the socket util that checks for reconnections and automatically tries to rejoin room
-Maybe have it that if the author gets kicked out of the room, everyone is kicked out too?

-Handle "check card lock" process on the server instead of the client
    -Need to have the following vars on the server:
        -last card
        -cards array


-"request change player" doesn't do anything
-Drawing a card doesn't take a card from a deck, it's just a set value at the moment
-Add in a deck generator when the game starts (Needs to be on server)
-End turn doesn't do anything

ROOM PROCESS
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
-when a player attempts to create a room:
    -Check to see if the room exists already
        -If the room belongs to the user
            -if the users socket belongs to the room, say they're already in it
            -else, say the room exists, the user just needs to rejoin room
        -Else send message to say "room name in use, choose another"

-when a player leaves the room:
    -Remove them from the socket list



BUGS
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

-Setting a password on a room doesn't have any effect at the moment
-There's no current way of limiting the number of players in the room
-When a player rejoins a room, it doesn't reload any of the assets that've already been placed in said room. Need to keep track of them
-Palming "max height" check doesn't work. Won't allow cards to be placed in bottom 2 rows of grid
-picking up card from scrollbar always ends up making the center point move upwards, making the card annoying to place
